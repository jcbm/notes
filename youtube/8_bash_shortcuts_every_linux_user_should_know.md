### [8 bash shortcuts every linux user should know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-AQAJXdoS8)

### Various shortcuts
Ctrl+**c** kills a running command (sends a SIGINT to all the processes in the foreground process group)

Ctrl+**d** exits shell session  

Ctrl+**l** (lowercase L) clears terminal (same as *clear* command)
#### Auto completion
Use tab single-press for auto-completion when writing out a command - only completes when there is only option. 

Tab double-press lists all possible completion options.

### Cursor movement
Ctrl+**A** goes to st**a**rt of line

Ctrl+**E** goes **e**nd of line 

Alt+**F** goes one word forward in sentence

Alt+**B** goes one word backwards in sentence

### history - tracks command history
**history** shows the last 500 commands entered (size can be reconfigured).

Ctrl+**r** does a reverse search of history - press repeatedly to go longer back in history.

Ctrl+**g** brings you back to what you input before searching.

Use !n to repeat the n'th command in the history list.

Fun fact: history is actually not a command but a built in shell-keyword.
